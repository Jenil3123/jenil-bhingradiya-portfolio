## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges was balancing visual richness with performance, especially for high-quality jewelry imagery. This was addressed by optimizing assets, refining layouts, and carefully structuring Shopify sections to maintain both speed and aesthetics. Another important learning was aligning design decisions closely with conversion goals rather than focusing on visuals alone.
